# Remote Control of USB Ports

This project serves as a Python example for remotely controlling USB ports on different computers. It simulates the process of opening and closing USB ports remotely using a simple command.

## How to Use

The project functions with a server and one or more clients. The server waits for commands from computers, while client computers send commands to the server. Sample commands include:

- `open`: Opens the USB ports.
- `close`: Closes the USB ports.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- socket library

## Installation

1. Start the server by running the `server.py` file.
2. Start the client by running the `client.py` file.
